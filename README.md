Inventory System Update

The problem to be solved will be mainly based on the update of an inventory system by means of data processing either by graphical interface or by 
data processing by means of either graphical interface or by means of csv file management.

The main problem will be to be able to update at any time the structure of the inventory system by means of data management with user interface and by means of file management. As it is well known, in a digital inventory system it is not only important to be able to insert, update or delete data through the main program, but now with the existence of a larger amount of data and raw materials, manually updating an inventory system becomes a tedious process.

So this project aims to automate the process of updating data by uploading files that allow the end user to generate the relevant updates by uploading or downloading csv files with the necessary information for the proper functioning of the business.

                                                              
                                                    Programming Language to be used

Elixir

                                                           Solution   


                                                                  
For the solution to be implemented, functional programming will be used mainly to build the main structure of the inventory system as well as to create the basic functions of inserting, updating and deleting records.

In addition, lists will be used as the main structure for the management of extensive data and to be able to have an order and a correct manipulation and assignment of values.

We will also implement some functions for reading and writing csv files, which will play an important role in the proper functioning of the inventory system.

The expected functionality of the program to be developed is to be able to carry out the operations of insertion, update or deletion of data and records manually through the manipulation of the system by the user but also to allow the upload and download of files that perform the same functions as the user in an efficient way.
